# AddressApp
AddressApp is a little application example done during our OOP lessons using JavaFX.
It's a JavaFX application designed as a beginner-friendly exercise for learning JavaFX and SceneBuilder. This project serves as a simple Address Book that interacts with users to manage and display contact information. Additionally, AddressApp demonstrates how to integrate JSON file handling using the Jackson library for data serialization and deserialization.
